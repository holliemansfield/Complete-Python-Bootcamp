# Hollie's Complete-Python-Bootcamp

## Welcome to the Repository for the Complete Python Bootcamp by JPortilla!

This is the Repository for the Udemy course - "Complete Python Bootcamp" that I have been working on.

You can purchase the course at a 50% discount by clicking [here](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/?couponCode=PYTHON15). 
Purchasing the course grants access to all the screencast videos and the moderated discussion forums!

In this repo you will find all the accompanying Jupyter (p.k.a. iPython) Notebooks for the course. For quicker view rendering and simpler downloading procedures, you can check out this repo using [NbViewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jmportilla/Complete-Python-Bootcamp/tree/master/).

I then navigated to your desired lecture and enjoy! You can download the .ipynb files onto your own computer for convenience.

I enjoyed the course and hopefully you will too!
